Welcome to my digital sandbox. I’m Salman – a computer engineer with a master’s in AI & Data Science.

This is where I try things, break things, and write about what I learned in the process. It’s not about polished projects. It’s about **curiosity**, **experimentation**, and **play**.

## **Leave a Thought – I’m All Ears**

If you stumble on something here and think:  
“Hey, I do that differently” or  
“There’s a better way” or  
“Wanna see a weird trick I use?” —  

**Please drop it. Seriously.**

- Prompting ideas  
- Better ways to structure code  
- Your favorite tech stacks  
- AI, full-stack, robotics – anything goes

I love hearing what works for *you*.  
You never know what tiny insight might change the way I think or build.

## **What You’ll Find Here**

A bunch of **experimental projects**.

Each repo is a little journal entry:
- Some are useful
- Some are just noodling around
- All are honest

Inside, you'll find my thoughts, what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and the weird paths I took to figure things out.

## **Now Playing With**

- Creating a full-stack project using **Cursor** + **ChatGPT text-to-speech-to-text** for prompting

Thanks for stopping by.  
Jump into any repo and feel free to comment, fork, remix, or just get inspired.

Let’s make GitHub a playground again.
