## Welcome to my page


Welcome to my digital sandbox. I’m Salman – a computer engineer with a master’s in computer science (AI & Data Science).

This is where I try things, break things, and write about what I learned in the process. It’s not about polished projects. It’s about **curiosity**, **experimentation**, and **play**.

## **Leave a Thought – I’m All Ears**

If you stumble on something here and think:  
“Hey, I do that differently” or  
“There’s a better way” or  
“Wanna see a weird trick I use?” —  

**Please drop it. Seriously.**

- Prompting ideas  
- Better ways to structure code  
- Your favorite tech stacks  
- AI, full-stack, robotics – anything goes

I love hearing what works for *you*.  
You never know what tiny insight might change the way I think or build.

## **What You’ll Find Here**

A bunch of **experimental projects**.

Each repo is a little journal entry:
- Some are useful
- Some are just noodling around
- Some are beautiful flops that helped me try something new

Inside, you'll find my thoughts, what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and the weird paths I took to figure things out.

## Now Playing With

- Creating a full-stack app by **speaking my way through it**  
  Using **ChatGPT’s speech-to-text** to craft prompts, and **Cursor** to turn those prompts into code.  
  Can you build a real project using only your voice? I’m finding out.

Thanks for stopping by.  
Jump into any repo and feel free to comment, fork, remix, or just get inspired.

Let’s make GitHub a playground again.
